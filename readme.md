# PipeSim

## Getting Started
With urban civil water demand increase, the burden of the previous water supply system is becoming heavier. Planning in advance is becoming increasingly important in the construction and renovation of the city water distribution network. 

The main mission for PipeSim is to help water companies to make the right planning and control the water loss. PipeSim incorporates hydraulic models and data mining models to do hydraulic simulation and water loss detection.

## Functions
### Hydraulic simulation
### Water loss detection

## Models
### Hydraulic models
### Data mining models
- space-time probabilistic model
